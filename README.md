# Brightsound

Brightsound is a 2D puzzle platformer in which the player manipulates light and sound to traverse the environment.
This game was made over the course of a weekend for the annual Global Game Jam Event. All art, sound, and music is original and
is not for public use for anything other than this game. However, all code is free to use and modify as desired, as is the nature of all public
repositories.
